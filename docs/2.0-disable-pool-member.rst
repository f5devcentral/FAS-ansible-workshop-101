Exercise 2.0: Exercise 2.0 - Disabling a pool member
====================================================

Objective
---------

For this last exercise instead of prescriptive step-by-step walkthrough a framework of objectives with hints for each step will be provided.  

Demonstrate the removal of a node from the pool.  Build a Playbook that:
  - Retrieve Facts from BIG-IP for the pool /Common/http_pool
  - Display pool member status to the terminal window
  - Store the pool members as a fact
  - Display pool member IP and port information to the terminal window
  - Forces a pool member offline
  
Guide
-----

**Step 1**

At this point your BIG-IP will have no configuraton if you sucessfully ran exercises 1.6 and 1.7
Before running this exercise please ensure that you have working pool members by running exercises 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4

Moving to the exercise:

Using your text editor of choice create a new file called `disable-pool-member.yml`.

.. code::

   [student1@ansible ~]$ nano disable-pool-member.yml


**Step 2**

Enter the following play definition into `disable-pool-member.yml`:

.. code::

   - name:  Disabling a pool member
     hosts: f5
     connection: local
     gather_facts: false

**Step 3**

Next, add a tasks section and create a task for the objective listed above:

- Retrieve Facts from BIG-IP for the pool /Common/http_pool

HINT: Try using the bigip_device_info module

**Step 4**

Next, add a task for the objective listed above:

- Display pools available to the terminal window

HINT: Remember to use the `register` keyword and the ansible debug module

**Step 5**

Next, add a task for the objective listed above:

- Store the pool members as a fact

HINT: An easy way to set fact variables within a Playbook dynamically is using the set_fact module

**Step 6**

Next, add a task for the objective listed above:

- Display pool member IP and port information to the terminal window

HINT: Remember to use the `register` keyword and the debug module

**Step 7**

Next, add a task for the objective listed above:

- Force Pool Member offline

HINT: Remember the bigip_pool_member module. Also remember to look at the state parameter

**Step 8**
Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host and execute the following:

.. code::

   [student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook disable-pool-member.yml
